# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

# Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the continuous, meticulous application of various engineering principles througout the stages of software development. This would be achieved through application of these principles across the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) to ensure clean code which is efficient, reliable and scalable.

# Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1950-1960: Which is the birth of Software Engineering. Within this  period, 1968 to be exact, the NATO Conference addressed the "software crisis" where the advancement of software outpaced the development of hardware development.
1970 -1980: This milestone saw the rise and adoption of structured programming as an improvement on code readability and maintainability, this would be exemplified by modular design & procedural programming.
1990- to date: This era saw a shift from rigid/linear development models to the more progressive and collaborative Agile Methodologies. This also brought forward DevOps which intergrates development and operations for continous software optimization and delivery.

# List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1 Requirement Analysis/Defining the problem - This is the first step in Software Development, where we ascertain the objectives of software, expected outcomes and the system requirements.
2 Planning - Here we Define the project timelines in relation to requirements, asess risks and create cost estimates.
3 Design - Carefully creating the system, possibly using Psuedo Code to plot UI & Database architecture
4 Development - Compiling and writing code as per design brief & specifications
5 Testing - Identifying and fixing any errors/bugs through the various testing levels (Unit Tests, Intergration Testing, System Testing, etc.)
6 Depolyment - Releasing of software to end-user
7 Maintainance & Support - Updating, Maintaining and continous optimization of software post deployment

# Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology uses a sequential approach which normaly is rigid and could be costly (if changes are required), this can be attributed to the minimal client involvement & testing normally executed at the end. This would be suitable for a Large project with well defined requirements like a Health System/Banking System

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
